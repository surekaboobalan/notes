Array  ;
----------
	=> Storing a group of value in a single reference name
	=> it allow a same set of datatypes (Homogeneous)

Types : 
-------
	* Single Dimensional Array --->[ ] 
	* Multi-Dimensional 	Array ----> [ ]  [ ]

Declaration 1 : 
--------------
=> Syntax	
-------------	
	Datatype refName [ ] = new Datatype [ length];
	length ---> starts from 1 to n 
	index ---> startes  from 0 to length -1

	value declaration : 

	    	refname [index] = value; 

 Declaration 2 
----------------

DataType  refName[ ] = { value1, value 2, value 3};


Feature : - 
-----------
	=>Array is index-Based
	=> It is fixed length 
	=> if we not initialize the value the default value of given datatype  will be declared for that index 
	=> if we assign the value for same index it will take the override value 
	=> it has high memory wastage (Disadvantage)




for each Loop 
----------------



=> It is Value Based 
=> no need to give any condition 
=> if its value present ---> it will go to inside loop 
=> if value is not present ---> it will not go to the loop 
=> No need to give any iteration
