CLASS CASTING/OBJECT CASTING
-----------------------------

* UPCASTING
* DOWN CASTING


UPCASTING
---------

 * ACCESSING CHILD  CLASS  OVERRIDE METHOD IN PARENT CLASS WITH THE  HELP OF

Syntax:

 PARENTCLASS NAME OBJECT NAME = NEW CHILDCLASS NAME ();

 * IT WILL RESTICT TO INVOKE CHILD CLASS OWN METHOD

 * WE WILL INVOKE EASILY OVERRIDE METHOD
*Super keyword should not be use 


DOWNCASTING
-----------

 * ACCSESSING PARENT CLASS PROPERTY INTO CHILD CLASS WITH THE HELP OF
     
       CHILDCLASSNAME   OBJECTNAME = NEW  PARENTCLASS NAME();//------> trying downcast

     (add to cast)
 * CHILDCLASSNAME  OBJECTNAME = (child class name )  NEW PARENTCLASSNAME ();


 * if we try to invoke the parent class method with the help of downcasting.

 * it throw class cast exception at run - time

 * so downcasting process is not possible in java .
