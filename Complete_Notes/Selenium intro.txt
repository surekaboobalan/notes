
Selenium : 

	*Selenium is a free and open-source test automation suite used for automating web-based applications. 
	
	*It supports automation across different browsers, platforms, and programming languages.

	* It is a automation testing tool

	* It depends upon programming languages like C, C++, Java and Python and so on.

	* with the help of programming language we interact the web applications only.

	* It is open source

	* previous : QTP (Quick Test Professional) and Mercury.


In web applications we mostly involved in Functional Testing, UI Automation Testing

	
	

Selenium Components / Selenium Suites :

	* Selenium IDE

	* Selenium RC (Remote Control)

	* Selenium WebDriver

	* Selenium Grid

Selenium IDE :

	=> Selenium IDE is a record and playback automation tool using which we can automate the web applications
	
	=> It comes in the form of a Chrome and Firefox browser extension.

	=> the first choice automation tool for people with no or limited programming language experience

Selenium RC :
	=>Selenium Remote Control(RC) is officially deprecated by Selenium
	
	=> Because ,it will not directly interact with our browser
	
	=> before executing the test scripts the server was required to be started.

	=>It used to inject the javascript code in the browser for automation and required an additional server for running the automation scripts.

	=> IDE ---------> Selenium RC -----------> WebBrowser

	=> In RC installation are complicated

	=> It Support JavaScript only


Selenium WebDriver :

	It will directly interact with our browser

	It supports different browsers and along with different programming languages

	It provides different drivers for different browsers and supports multiple programming languages.

	It is purely object-oriented and supports all the major browsers – Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, etc and 

	scripting can be done in most of the popular languages – Java, Python, Ruby, etc. 
    
                  IT CANT SUPPORT MULTITHREADING.

                  old    version    3.141.59


Selenium Grid :
---------------

	It supports Multi-Threading

	it will support multiple test cases at a same time with the help of HubNode Concept 

	These nodes are connected to a central hub which acts as a server and controls the whole test execution.



Limitations :
	
	*Selenium does not provide desktop application automation support.	

	* Automate Only web applications not other based applications like mobile applications (APPIUM)TOOL

	* We cannot read the Captcha and we cant submit the OTP
	
	* Selenium WebDriver requires programming language requirements for script creation.

	* Sometime the Elements methods not working in some elements

	* We cant perform scrollup and scroll down operations but with the 

	help of JavaScriptExecutor interface we can perform that actions .

	* We cant generate the reports

BROWSERNAME	             CLASS NAME         	          	KEY                       			 VALUE ( .exe file)

*chrome		                ChromeDriver            	 webdriver.chrome.driver(small Letter)        		 chromedriver.exe

*Edge		                 EdgeDriver             	  webdriver.edge.driver (small)           		 EdgeDriver.exe

*FireFox		              FireFoxDriver           	 webdriver.gecko.driver  (small)         		 geckodriver.exe



if we use selenium 3 JSON Wire Protocol 

		it will check my real browser version along with .exe file version

		both versions are same -----> it will create the session

		versions are mismatch -----> it will throw SessionNotCreatedException at Run-Time



if we use selenium 4 W3C Protocol

W3C : World Wide Web Consortium

JSON : JavaScript Object Notation


	

Downloads : 

	Selenium 4 download

	Location  in c or d and extract the jar file



How to add the selenium jar in our project	:

	Right click on your Project -----> configure Build path ----> choose libraries -----> Add external jar
 	-----> choose location  -> Apply and close.



How to add the Chrome Driver in our project :

	Right click on your Project -----> New -----> Folder ------> Folder name as ( Driver ) ------> copy the Chrome Driver
	-----> Paste it on Driver Folder
