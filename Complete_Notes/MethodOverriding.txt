Method Overriding 

=>If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java

Rules for Java Method Overriding
The method must have the same name as in the parent class
The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.

=>METHOD OVERRIDEING / RUN-TIME POLYMORPHISM / DYNAMIC BINDING

WE HAVE TWO CLASSES ONE IS PARENT AND ANOTHOR IS CHILD with extend keyword


IF WE INVOKE THE SAME METHOD IN CHILD IT WILL INVOKE @OVERRIDE ANNOTATION 
BY USING SUPER KEY WORD IT WILL HELPFUL TO INVOKE THE PARENT CLASS METHOD  DATA


@OVERRIDE ANNOTATION-->IT Indicates that the child class method is over-writing its base class method

// IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS RUN - TIME POLYMRPHISM / DYNAMIC BINDING
