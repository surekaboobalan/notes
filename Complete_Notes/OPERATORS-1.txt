 OPERATORS
 ---------

  OPERATOR ARE SPECIFIC SYMBOLS THAT PERFORM SPECIFIC OPERATION

  TYPES
----
  * ARITHMETIC
  *Unary ---------------> (* postfix,prefix) 
  *LOGICAL
  *RELATIONAL OR COMPARSION 
  *STRING

  ARITHMETIC
----------

  * Arithmetic operators are uesd in mathematical expression in the same way that they are used in
  algebra

  * following are the types of arithmetic operator

   +  --> addition
   -  -->subraction
   *  -->multiplication
   /  -->division (returns our queation value)
   %  -->modules (returns reminder value)

   UNARY OPERATOR
---------------

   ++ --> increment  (a++--->(a+1=) Postfix,  ++a ---> prefix)
   --   --> decrement

MODULE OPERATOR
---------------

* the module operator "%" returns the reminder of division operation.

* it can be applied to both floating point types and integer types.




RELATIONAL OR COMPARITIONAL OPERATORS
-------------------------------------

* THE RELATIONAL OPERATORS DETERMINE THE RELATION ONE OPERATOR HAS TO OTHERS
* IT ALSO GIVE BOOLEAN RESULT

1) == EQUAL           EG: 5==9 --> its throug false
2) != not equal       EG: 6!=4 --> its through true
3) <  less than       EG: 3<2  --> its through false
4) <= less than or equal EG: 5<= 5 --> its through true
5) > greater than        EG: 4>3 --> its through true
6) >= greater than or equal  EG: 5>=5 --> its shows true




LOGICAL OPERATORS
------------------
  
*LOGICAL OPERATORS GIVE BOOLEAN RESULT


  && = logical "and" evaluates to true , when both operators are true---> 
(AND)
    @ it will show true when both the values are true


 || =  logical "or" evaluates to true , when either one operand is true
(OR)


 !=  SSlogical  "not" evaluates to true if the operand is false
(Not)



String Operator
---------------

its joins two strings ---> Concatenation

eg: "A" + "BC" + 10 +10= ABC1010
